Problem Statement:
Suppose we have a machine that creates molecules by combining atoms.
We are creating water molecules by joining one Oxygen and two Hydrogen
atoms. The atoms are represented by threads. The machine will wait for
the required atoms (threads), then group one Oxygen and two Hydrogen
threads to simulate the creation of a molecule. The molecule then exists
the machine. You have to ensure that one molecule is completed before
moving onto the next molecule. If more than the required number of
threads arrive, they will have to wait.
